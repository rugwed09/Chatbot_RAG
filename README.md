# Chatbot_RAG
Build a RAG Chatbot using LangChain to augment responses with external knowledge from a dataset, utilizing OpenAI models and Pinecone.

# Building a RAG Chatbot with LangChain

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot using LangChain, a library for chaining together language models and other components to create sophisticated chatbot applications. The project leverages various tools and libraries, including OpenAI's GPT models, the Hugging Face datasets library, Pinecone for vector database management, and others.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Python installed and are familiar with pip, Python's package installer. You'll need to install the following libraries:
pip install -qU langchain==0.0.354 openai==1.6.1 datasets==2.10.1 pinecone-client==3.0.0 tiktoken==0.5.2


Building a Simple Chatbot (No RAG)
Initially, we'll create a basic chatbot without retrieval augmentation. This involves using the ChatOpenAI class from LangChain, initialized with your OpenAI API key.

Interacting with the Chatbot
Chat interactions with GPT models (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) follow a structured format where roles like "system", "user", and "assistant" define the flow of conversation. LangChain simplifies this with SystemMessage, HumanMessage, and AIMessage classes.

Importing Data for RAG
To augment our chatbot with retrieval capabilities, we use the Hugging Face datasets library to load a dataset serving as the chatbot's external knowledge base.

Building the Knowledge Base with Pinecone
Next, we initialize a connection to Pinecone and set up an index for storing vector embeddings of our dataset, which will enable fast retrieval of relevant information.

Embedding and Indexing Data
We use OpenAI's text-embedding model to generate embeddings for our dataset and index them in Pinecone.

Retrieval Augmented Generation
To augment our chatbot responses with external knowledge, we query our Pinecone index for relevant information based on the chatbot's prompts and include this information in the chatbot's responses.

Cleanup
Finally, don't forget to delete your Pinecone index to save resources.
